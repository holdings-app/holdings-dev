# Transaction Producer

The goal of the transaction producer is to allow users to sync transactions from
multiple brokers and analyze it in a unified and consistent way; removing the
need to perform manual steps and wrangle with spreadsheets.

The transaction producer, extracts user transactions from broker websites and
stores them on [Holdings](https://holdings.dev), where they can be aggregated
into a normalized format.
